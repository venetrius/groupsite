             <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;I was at a meetup a few weeks ago in Phoenix where a bunch of beginner programmers were getting together to learn React. I'm hoping to replicate that here in Calgary!
            </p><p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;I would say the prerequisites for the meetup is basic knowledge of programming. What conditional statements are, what loops are, objects, arrays, dictionaries, classes etcetera. If anyone is interested in joining this is something that can probably be learnt in 5-10 hours, depending on your current knowledge.
            </p><p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;We also have a mix of everyone from people brand new to programming to those currently working in the field.
            </p><p> 
                &nbsp;&nbsp;We're open to any ideas on how to structure the sessions. If you're a local company and you have space, food or something else you think would be useful, we'd love any kind of donation or sponsorship.

        That's how things started. And it was not a long time ago, and not too much happened since.
        The goal is the group to learn together. We started with React and will go with whatever we find important. 
        <br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;If you think you would spend a day every month working on a project with an awesome group, to learn new technologies and create some cool stuff, then join us!
        The most reasonable thing to do is to join the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Software-Developers-Learning-Together/events/">Meetup group</a>.&nbsp;
        For the sake of this website, you can also <a onClick={() => this.props.onClick("Join us")} href="#"> subscribe</a> to our mail list.
